# Ml_classification_regression
Hi ! all, In this repository I detailly tell about the problem identification and creating AI according to the problem statemnt
Please go through the problem statement carefully and Read the insurance_charge_prediction.pdf


A client’s requirement is, he wants to predict the insurance charges based on the several parameters. The Client has provided the dataset of the same.As a data scientist, you must develop a model which will predict the insurance charges.                
   1) Identify your problem statement
   2) Tell basic info about the dataset (Total number of rows, columns)
   3) Mention the pre-processing method if you’re doing any (like converting string to number –nominal data)
   4) Develop a good model with r2_score.You can use any machine learning algorithm; you can create many models.Finally, you have to come up with final model.
   5) All the research values (r2_score of the models) should be documented.
   6) Mention your final model, justify why u have chosen the same
